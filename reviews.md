# Paper Reviews

You are expected to write and submit a paper review of the readings before each class, and answer some questions about the readings.  The review should be akin to a conference paper review.  The purpose of the readings is to provide an illustrative example of the research area.  You are encouraged but not required to read the supplemental readings to better understand the materials.  

You can discuss questions and ask for clarifications with your colleagues and/or on piazza.  You are expected to formulate your own opinion of the reading(s) and write the review yourself.  See for a description of what we expect in paper reviews.  

We may select a random review to read and discuss in class.  This serves to highlight important characteristics of reading papers and writing good reviews.


### Submission

The first review ([System R](#lec2)) is special, so look  at the paper description for submission details.  


Otherwise, follow the following instructions: 

* [Submission form](https://goo.gl/forms/uNfVx9jUBXdj6wXd2)
* Reviews are due 6PM EST day before lecture.  
* Late submissions are given a score of 0 without prior approval.  
* You may miss submissions for up to **2 lectures**.


### Reading Tips

Ask the following questions while readings

* What is the context of this work?
  * What was the unmet need or opportunity?  Does it make sense?
  * What were existing approaches and why do they work or not work?
  * Does the paper (and its contributions) matter?
  * What are the actual hypotheses?
* Approach
  * How do they seek to validate their hypotheses? Do they make sense?
  * Is the evaluation cursory or deep?
  * Do you believe their results?
  * Are the results presented well?

# The Papers


### L2 System R Overview <a name="lec2"/>

Readings 

* Required: <a href="./files/papers/systemr-retrospective.pdf">System R Retrospective</a>
* Optional: <a href="./files/papers/ingres-retrospective.pdf">Ingres Design</a>


Paper Review 

* System R was an impressive research and engineering effort, and the reading is a retrospective of the 6 year project.  
* The paper discusses "the Convoy Problem".  Discuss the problem:  What is it?  Why does it exist?
* The paper discusses many many topics.  Identify and pick one aspect (different than the convoy problem) that you are particularly impressed with.  Discuss what and why.
* Note: The format of this review will be different than future reviews because this is a warmup paper

Submission

* Due: 12PM Thursday 1/24

Paper Review 

* What were the main goals for the Postgres system and why do you think they chose those goals?  Do they make sense?
* Pick one of the (many) ideas in the paper that most interests you.  Why is it interesting?   Does the proposed design hold water?  Feel free to read related work.
* Note: The format of this review will be different than future reviews because this is a warmup paper
