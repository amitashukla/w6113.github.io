Paper Review 

* System R was an impressive research and engineering effort, and the reading is a retrospective of the 6 year project.  
* The paper discusses "the Convoy Problem".  Discuss the problem:  What is it?  Why does it exist?
* The paper discusses many many topics.  Identify and pick one aspect (different than the convoy problem) that you are particularly impressed with.  Discuss what and why.
* Note: The format of this review will be different than future reviews because this is a retrospective paper.
